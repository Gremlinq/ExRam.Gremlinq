**Describe the bug**
A clear and concise description of what the bug is.

**Expected behavior**
A clear and concise description of what you expected to happen.

**Version information**
Tell us which version of ExRam.Gremlinq you are using.

**Minimal working example**
You **MUST** provide one of the following

- a link to GitHub repository containing a minimal executable project
structure that exposes the unexpected behaviour. By 'minimal' we mean that you should omit any code
that is not directly necessary to show the unexpected behaviour. **Make sure you remove any sensible
data (e.g. passwords etc). Don't post tons of business POCOs or DTOs that
are not really relevant for exposing the unexpected behaviour.**

- a pull request to ExRam.Gremlinq that adds a failing unit test to the ExRam.Gremlinq tests asserting
the expected behaviour. Again, this should be minimal to reduce noise.

If the issue contains neither of these things, it will be labelled accordingly and become stale.
Please understand that I ask for this much effort from you in exchange for my work since
it is tedious and time-consuming to isolate the relevant bits from an issue each time just to setup
a new project that might not even fail then.

**Additional context**
Add any other context about the problem here.
